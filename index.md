## WELCOME TO THE POOL "STAKING FOR SCIENCE"

Dear Cardanians, using our services you can stake you ADA safely and passively EARN ADA TOKENS (5% rewards/year) while helping us support scientific research. Indeed, 10% of the profit generated by our servers per year (obtained via operator pledge rewards) will be donated towards international labs conducting research on age-related diseases, such as cancer, Parkinson or Alzheimer.  

We provide a substantial pledge of 30.000 ADA to ensure getting rewards and we propose NO FEE (0%) until reaching pool saturation. Then we will apply a 2% variable fee to better involve our deleguators and increase donation to research institution. 

Current live stake : 263 540 ADA : To all of you, thanks for your trust!
